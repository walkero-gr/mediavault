//// BUGS
*********
FIXED - When ooNetwork is used I get some unfreed signals on exit
FIXED - ooNetwork truncates the return info, so for now only 5 items return. Now it shows 20 stations. Maybe I need to some kind of pagination, based on the scrollbar.
FIXED - A bug on requesting radio stations without using the filters
